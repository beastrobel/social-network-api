# Social Network Api

## Description

The challenge was to create the back-end of a social media website, where the user is able to view, add, modify, and delete Users, Thoughts, Reactions, and Friends. The application was developed using NoSQL MongoDB and Express. It uses mongoose models and schemas to create BSON objects for the social network database. The user is able to perform CRUD operations using Insomnia. This project was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed learning the basics of how a social media website works! 


## Usage

To use the social network api, please install MongoDB and Express. The video below demonstrates the functionality:
